# â—‰ Bound: a fully customizable, open-world RPG.
Recent sandbox games such as Minecraft and Garry's Mod allow users to create unique experiences through the power of modding. My goal for this project is to combine RPGs' style with a limitless and intuitive, programmable interface.

<i>Disclaimer: This project is currently in its concept stage. I am open to any ideas or collaboration. But its progress may be unpredictable as it's purely a side project (and not my full-time job).</i>
